Create your branch and when you clone the codes make sure you all delete, Package.json, package.lock-json, node modules
make sure your terminal is in server folder then run : npm init -y then npm i express bcrypt pg nodemon cors express-fileupload
and then go to package.json and make the chnages : 
"scripts": {
    "devStart": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
